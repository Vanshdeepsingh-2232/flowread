## ✨ Features

- **☁️ Seamless Cloud Sync**: Authenticate with Firebase to sync your reading progress and library across all your devices.
- **⚡ Local-First Performance**: Uses Dexie (IndexedDB) for blazing fast, offline-ready library management.
- **🎨 Premium Themes**:
  - **Midnight**: Deep blue-black for late-night immersion.
  - **Slate**: Balanced dark gray for professional reading.
  - **Paper**: Warm, textured sepia tone for a classic paperback feel.
  - **Daylight**: High-contrast light mode for outdoor clarity.
- **📊 Reading Insights**: Track your streaks, total read time, and vocabulary build-up.
